## Rock Paper Scissors Dataset Image Classification with FastAI from Scratch

These notebooks contain the code from the medium blog articles from the series: [A Fast Introduction to Fastai-My Experience.](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-fast-introduction-to-fastai-my-experience-b18d4457f6a5?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)

The ipynb files are as follows: 
1. **RPC.ipynb**: Simple image classification with fastai library, an introduction
2. **RPC-Pixel-sim.ipynb**: Image classification with Pixel Similarity Approach
3. **RPC SGD.ipynb**: Image classification with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Cross Entropy Loss function
4. **RPC-Learning Rate, Progressive Resizing Approach.ipynb** : Image Classification, state of the art training with learning rate finder, progressing resizing approach.
5. **Text Sentiment Classification(Covid-19 Tweets).ipynb** : Text Classification in just 20 lines of code

Next up: An interactive web app interface with the ability to run image classification on any uploaded image.
